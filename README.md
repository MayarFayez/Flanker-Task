# Flanker-Task
Mental process known as cognitive control.  
we’re going to define cognitive control as the ability to ignore irrelevant stimuli
in order to do the task correctly.

• Subjects are typically slower and less accurate
in the Incongruent condition, and faster and
more accurate in the Congruent condition.  
• Since the difference in reaction times is robust
and reliable, it follows that in our fMRI data we
should see a noticeable difference in the BOLD
signal as well.  
## Experimental Paradigm

• The subject is shown a fixation cross in order to focus on the center of the screen, 
and then either a Congruent or Incongruent Flanker trial is presented for 2000ms.  
• During the trial the subject presses either the left or right button.  
• A jittered interval follows which lasts anywhere from 8,000ms to 14,000ms.  
• Our goal is to estimate the magnitude of the BOLD signal to each condition, and
then contrast (i.e., take the difference of) the two conditions to see whether they 
are significantly different from each other.
